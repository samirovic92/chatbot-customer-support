# Chatbot Customer Support

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.1.7. I use framework [Ngrx](https://ngrx.io/docs) for state management, [Angular material](https://material.angular.io/)  for UI component infrastructure.

The project is hosted in [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) using [github Actions]().

To access to chatbot in prod (firebase url)  you can use one of the following url : [chatbot-1](https://chatbot-customer-support-85997.web.app/) or [chatbot-2](https://chatbot-customer-support-85997.firebaseapp.com/)

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```
